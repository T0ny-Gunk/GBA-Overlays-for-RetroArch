# GBA-Overlays-for-RetroArch
I decided to create authentic looking overlays after seeing many on the internet.

I got inspired by some of the default overlays in RetroArch and wanted to implement one which would show different overlays even if you change orientation from horizontal to vertical and vice versa. I used most of the assets for buttons from RetroArch.

I have used PhotoPea and RetroPad Editor to make these. I'm still a beginner so my initial work will look shoddy so apologies :), I'm still learning.

I would like to give credits to Reddit user u/Cris_250299 whose post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EmulationOnAndroid/comments/mg9o7e/universal_snessfc_skin_for_retroarch/) gave me the idea about seamlessly switching orientations and to Reddit user u/Lyceux whose post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RetroArch/comments/1d9adim/wasnt_a_fan_of_the_existing_overlays_so_i_made_my/) helped me used the assets that they designed for this project. Shout out to both of them!
