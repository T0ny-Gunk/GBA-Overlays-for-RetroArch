# GBA-Overlays-for-RetroArch
I decided to create authentic looking overlays after seeing many on the internet.

I got inspired by some of the default overlays in RetroArch and wanted to implement one which would show different overlays even if you change orientation from horizontal to vertical and vice versa. I used most of the assets for buttons from RetroArch.

I have used PhotoPea and RetroPad Editor to make these. I'm still a beginner so my initial work will look shoddy so apologies :), I'm still learning.

Feedback will be appreciated, thanks in advance.
